She should have died hereafter;
There would have been a time for such a word.
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
